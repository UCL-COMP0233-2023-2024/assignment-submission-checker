class BaseAssignmentTestingClass:
    """
    Base class that provides a framework for testing the Assignment class.
    By inheriting from this class, other unit tests for methods of the
    Assignment class don't have to worry about setup nor redefining a fixture
    to use.

    This class defines a fixture Assignment (placeholder_assignment) that can
    be used whilst testing. This placeholder assignment assumes the following
    directory structure:

    candidate_number/
    - assignment/
    - - .git/
    - - code_file_1.py
    - - code_file_2.py
    - - data/
    - - - data_file_1.dat

    The class also defines a fixture that automatically wraps any tests that are
    defined. extract_run_teardown can be passed a data_path parameter and will
    automatically set the placeholder_assignment's target archive to the path
    provided, extract it, run the wrapped test, and then handle removal of the
    extracted files (regardless of test result).
